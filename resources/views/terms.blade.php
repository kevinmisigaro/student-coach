                The Student Coach (TSC)
            </p>
            <p>
                We provide curated communities and coaching for students and young professionals. For many students, accessing relevant information for academic, study abroad and career success can often be confusing. Does this sound like you? At the Student Coach, we believe in the power of peer-mentoring by connecting students, graduates, and young professionals to support academic, professional and career aspirations.
